# Image Converter

This is a static web app that allows users to upload an image and transform it into various sizes and formats. 
The generated icons will be named according to the format `icon{size}.{extension}`.

## Usage

Go to [this website](https://la-lo-go.github.io/icon-converter/) to try it out.
All image processing will be done locally in your browser so images will not be sent to anyone.
